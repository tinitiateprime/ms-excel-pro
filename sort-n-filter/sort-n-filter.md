# Tutorial: Sort and Filter Data in Excel

In this tutorial, we'll use the provided sample data to practice sorting and filtering in Excel. We'll be working with the **Sales Data** as an example, but the steps can be applied to any of the provided datasets.

## 1. Sorting Data

Sorting data in Excel helps you organize your information in a meaningful way. You can sort data alphabetically, numerically, or by date.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Sorting:

### 1.1 Open the Sales Data

1. Open Excel and input the Sales Data or import it from a CSV file.
2. Make sure your data is organized in a table with headers.

### 1.2 Sort by a Single Column

1. Click on any cell in the column you want to sort by (e.g., `Product`).
2. Go to the `Data` tab on the Ribbon.
3. Click on the `Sort A to Z` button (for ascending order) or the `Sort Z to A` button (for descending order).

### 1.3 Sort by Multiple Columns

1. Click on any cell in your data range.
2. Go to the `Data` tab on the Ribbon.
3. Click on the `Sort` button to open the Sort dialog box.

6. In the `Order` dropdown, select `A to Z` or `Z to A`.
7. Click on the `Add Level` button to add another column for sorting.
8. Repeat steps 4-6 for the next column (e.g., `Total Sales`).
9. Click `OK` to apply the sort.

## 2. Filtering Data

Filtering data in Excel allows you to display only the information that meets certain criteria.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Filtering:

### 2.1 Open the Sales Data

1. Open Excel and input the Sales Data or import it from a CSV file.
2. Make sure your data is organized in a table with headers.

### 2.2 Apply Filters

1. Click on any cell in your data range.
2. Go to the `Data` tab on the Ribbon.
3. Click on the `Filter` button. This will add a dropdown arrow to each column header.

### 2.3 Filter by a Single Column

1. Click the dropdown arrow in the column you want to filter (e.g., `Category`).
2. In the dropdown menu, uncheck `Select All` to clear all selections.
3. Check the boxes next to the items you want to filter by (e.g., `Electronics`).
4. Click `OK` to apply the filter. Only the rows that meet the criteria will be displayed.

### 2.4 Filter by Multiple Columns

1. Apply the filter to the first column as described above.
2. Click the dropdown arrow in another column you want to filter (e.g., `Total Sales`).
3. Use the number filters to apply conditions. For example, select `Number Filters` > `Greater Than` and enter a value (e.g., 500).
4. Click `OK` to apply the filter. The data will now be filtered based on multiple criteria.

### 2.5 Clear Filters

1. To clear a filter from a column, click the filter icon in the column header.
2. Select `Clear Filter from [Column Name]`.

3. To clear all filters, go to the `Data` tab and click the `Clear` button in the `Sort & Filter` group.

## Practice Exercise

1. **Sort the Sales Data**:
   - Sort the data by `Category` in ascending order.
   - Then, sort by `Total Sales` in descending order within each category.

2. **Filter the Sales Data**:
   - Filter the data to show only `Electronics` category.
   - Further filter the data to show only sales where `Total Sales` is greater than 300.

By following these steps, you can effectively sort and filter your data in Excel, making it easier to analyze and work with large datasets.
